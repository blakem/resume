<font size="+2"><b>Where Am I Supposed to Be? Let Me Check My E-mail</b></font><p>
Nine thousand people can't be wrong -- at least not when it comes to remembering the important events in their lives. Blake D. Mills IV, <i>EAS'98,</i> has made sure of that with his online calendar service, <a href="http://calendar.stwing.upenn.edu./">Remind U-Mail,</a> which logged its nine-thousandth member in late January.
<br><img src="./The Pennsylvania Gazette  Remind U-Mail_files/dot_clear.gif" width="15" height="0">Last summer Mills devised a computer program "to send [myself] personal reminders via e-mail." Friends soon asked if he could expand the program for their use, and Mills decided that a Web-based calendar and e-mail reminder service "would be a fun project to work on." Setting up the system took him about a month's worth of spare time; Remind U-Mail, as Mills officially dubbed it, was up and running by 
October.
<br><img src="./The Pennsylvania Gazette  Remind U-Mail_files/dot_clear.gif" width="15" height="0">Since then, people from all over the world -- including Iceland, Egypt, Tobago, Paraguay, Eritrea, and Tuvalu -- have been recalling their significant dates with Remind U-Mail. Unlike the calendar programs that are standard on most PCs, Remind U-Mail can be accessed from anywhere in the world.
<br><img src="./The Pennsylvania Gazette  Remind U-Mail_files/dot_clear.gif" width="15" height="0">Mills -- a Colorado native who started out as an electrical engineering major before switching to computer science -- says he's able to manage the free service because it "essentially runs itself." Members sign up and, after receiving a user name and password, fill in their monthly calendars; they subsequently receive reminders via e-mail "simply by pointing and clicking." Mills's only administrative task thus far has been to respond to e-mails from people with questions about the service, which requires an hour or two each week.
<br><img src="./The Pennsylvania Gazette  Remind U-Mail_files/dot_clear.gif" width="15" height="0">Remind U-Mail is available free-of-charge, not only to students but to anyone with an e-mail account, partly because it operates through Penn's computer system and because, as Mills avows, "The Internet exists because a lot of people cooperate; I'm just doing my part to give back to that community."
<br><img src="./The Pennsylvania Gazette  Remind U-Mail_files/dot_clear.gif" width="15" height="0">The service has been featured on CNN's <i>Headline News </i>and CNBC; Mills himself has appeared on several radio talk shows. Articles in <i>The New York Daily News, The Los Angeles Times, </i>and an Italian magazine called <i>The Internet News,</i> among others, have helped boost its membership; between November 1 and January 31, the Website was visited 762,000 times.
<br><img src="./The Pennsylvania Gazette  Remind U-Mail_files/dot_clear.gif" width="15" height="0">All this cyber-traffic raises some concerns regarding privacy, of both members' e-mail addresses and the information they enter into their personal calendars; Mills assures them that he does not sell e-mail addresses or "snoop around in their password-protected calendars." As he told <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education,</i> though:  "Obviously, people who have private information they don't want [others] to know probably shouldn't put it on there."
<br><img src="./The Pennsylvania Gazette  Remind U-Mail_files/dot_clear.gif" width="15" height="0">During its short history, Remind U-Mail has received more than a few awards, including Yahoo's Pick of the Week, Microsoft Network's Pick of the Day, Computer Currents Interactive Pick of the Week, and Web Crawler's Select Site award.
