I am a senior software developer seeking a position starting in mid-September.  I have been doing Agile development for over ten years and am a believer in TDD, short iterations, pairing, refactoring, and continuous deployment.  I have used a wide range of technologies and have been building large-scale web products since I created the first online calendar as a collegiate side project back in 1997.

I've been writing software since I was about nine years old.  My father is a retired HP employee and I remember writing BASIC and Pascal on one of the first home computers back in the day.
